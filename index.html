            I'll start out by saying, thank you. Thank you for taking the time
            for visiting my portfolio that is still under construction, here's
            your hard hat to continue the my page. My name is Celin Castro, and
            I was born in The Golden State-California, raised in The Great State
            of Texas, and now I live in Colorful Colorado! I'm currently a
            student at the University of Denver attending a coding bootcamp to
            get ahead in life and find a career. The reason I decided to built
            this page is to introduce myself to the world of coding and to
            showoff my work, that I've done so far and I promise there's more to
            come!
